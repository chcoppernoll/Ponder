These rules assume 4-players with a non-infinite board

Movement Rules
	Every turn a player can choose to move 1 piece
	There are two types of movements, slides and jumps
		A player can only do one of these two types of moves per turn
	A slide is when a piece is moved into any adjacent tile
		A slide immediately ends the players turn
	A jump is when a piece is moved over another piece (think checkers)
		This is only possible if there is not another piece on the opposite side of the jumped piece
		A jump is basically an extended slide (as far as piece movement, etc. is concerned)
		No jumping back (in order to "undo" a move)
		If jumping an enemy's piece, that piece is immediately removed from the board (exiled) after the jump is completed
			Any flags the piece "held" remain on the board
		A jump ends when there are no more possible jumps or the player stops movement

Spawning Rules
	Exiled pieces have to spend at minimum 1 turn before they are "spawn-able"
		ie. Player has to play one turn after pieces are exiled before they can be spawned
	You can only spawn exiled pieces
		You can spawn 2 pieces in 1 turn, if both pieces are spawned adjacent to your flag
		Otherwise, you can spawn a maximum of 1 piece per turn
	You can spawn a piece on any tile excepting
		Tiles with a piece or flag
		Tiles adjacent to an unoccupied flag
		Tiles adjacent to an enemy piece
	Spawning must occur before the movement phase
		Spawning is optional (can be defered to a later turn)
		Spawned pieces cannot be moved the turn they are spawned

Victory Rules
	The goal of the game is to have control of a set number of flags at the end of your turn
		The exact number needed is player and mode dependent
		For 4v4, you need control of 3 flags	

Other Rules
	No piece may control more than 1 flag at any time unless one of those flags is the player's
		Otherwise the old flag is "dropped" before the piece is moved
	If a piece has no possible slides and is not adjacent to a friendly piece, that piece is exiled
		- "Corner" rule

Board State
	9x9 for 4x4, non-infinite
		Flags are placed one tile in (towards the center) from the four corners
		Player pieces are aligned radially from the flag (with two pieces have the same x coordinate and two having the same y coordinate)
	12x12 for 4x4, infinite
		Same placement as 9x9, flags are placed two tiles in
